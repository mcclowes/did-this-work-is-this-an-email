(Jake is sitting at his desk when Amir rushes in)

__Amir:__ Sorry sorry sorry sorry sorry sorry sorry! Did anybody notice that I was late?

__Jake:__ Nope, nobody noticed because nobody's here.

__Amir:__ Okay, so no. Perfecto.

__Jake:__ Everybody noticed that you weren't at work today, though.

__Amir:__ But nobody noticed that I was nay late?

__Jake:__ Nope, I guess not, just me, who's here at 11 doing your work for you.

__Amir:__ Okay, please don't turn this into a thing.

__Jake:__ I mean... how do you even be 13 hours late to work?

__Amir:__ Um... I guess I set my alarm for 8 and I snoozed. I snoozed it until seven chirty [sic], and then I raced here as fast as I could.

__Jake:__ Okay, well given the fact that that's sad on its own... why did it take you three and a half hours to get to work?

__Amir:__ (Pulls out a McDonald's bag) Pit stop!

__Jake:__ Nice! Is your computer in that bag?

__Amir:__ Ah, sheesh, no. But, there is a third-pounder here with your name on it, brotha.

__Jake:__ That's disgusting, please put it away.

__Amir:__ Okay.

__Jake:__ I mean, why are you even here? What are you doing here?

__Amir:__ Um... I was gonna save that for your 18th birthday, b—

__Jake:__ Okay, I'm 22.

__Amir:__ But! Let me finish! (Rushes over to Jake's computer and types on his keyboard for some time) Made us a website.

__Jake:__ Yeah, yeah you did. Jake and Amir did this work how do I hit send is this an email Jake—

__Amir:__ (Talking along with Jake) email Jake dot—yeah. Okay.

__Jake:__ —dot org.

__Amir:__ Ya brotha. And it's blue, which is pretty much the chillest color for a website.

__Jake:__ You pretty much spelled my name with two 'k's, why?

__Amir:__ Y2K?

__Jake:__ Seriously though.

__Amir:__ 'j' 'a' 'k' 'k' 'e'. Okay yeah. Must have been a fingor [sic] slip. When I—

__Jake:__ Twice.

__Amir:__ Uh, yeah. I—okay. "Jake" with one 'k'. Now I know that. Going forward.

__Jake:__ Okay, how 'bout the dot org. Why is that?

__Amir:__ Um... I think dot com was taken.

__Jake:__ Probably not.

__Amir:__ Yeah. I don't know. Well, I mean, why are you critiquing it? Look, it's pretty much the chillest site devoted to us.

__Jake:__ I guess I just don't understand why anybody in their right mind would go to a website about us. Just seems really boring.
